always learning

This repository contains some of my early work at WeThinkCode -CPT. 
Including the first project, Libft and some exam practice. 

Libft is the library each student must create because we are not allowed to use almost all the existing functions in standard libraries
other than write, malloc, free, open, read and maybe a few others that I have forgotten. 

and exam prep is pretty self explanatory.
